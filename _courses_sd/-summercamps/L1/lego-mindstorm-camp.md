shortDescription : "Programming controls Lego Mindstorms robots, learning the principles of programming through challenges, and make programming more interesting."
description: "Lego Mindstorms is one of the most popular forms of robotics around the world, known for its accessibility and simplicity. In this summer course, we challenge students to create useful, practical, and noteworthy inventions using the Lego Mindstorms building kit. Students will learn to use a variety of sensors such as levers, gears, motors, and infrared light, and learn various modules and programming logic. With hands-on learning, students can fully stimulate their imagination, enhance their creative talents, and improve their logical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills."
