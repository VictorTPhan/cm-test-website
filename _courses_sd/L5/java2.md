- title: "Be the Next Successful Entrepreneur"
  text: "We believe that practical hands-on skills are far more important than theoretical knowledge. Every class is set up to provide students with the ability to solve specific real-world problems through programming. At the same time, we will teach students about STEM entrepreneurship so that they learn how to take an idea and turn it into reality through hard work."
