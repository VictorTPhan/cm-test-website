## About the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF)

The Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) is an annual science event owned and managed by the Society for Science, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Washington D.C. Every May, over 1,800 students from about 75 countries and regions gather to compete for various prizes including scholarships, tuition grants, internships, scientific field trips, with awards featuring one $75,000 and two $50,000 college scholarships. The total prize pool exceeds $8,000,000. The culmination of the fair includes two major award ceremonies: the Special Awards Ceremony (now including Government Awards) and the Grand Awards Ceremony.


## Medals and Participants

Participants are selected through local, state, and international ISEF-affiliated fairs, which often cover broad regions across multiple states or entire countries. Local fair committees are responsible for organizing these events in their respective cities.

The competition features both individual and team scientific projects, with teams consisting of 2 to 4 high school students (grades 9 to 12). Besides project evaluation and public exhibitions, students have opportunities to partake in tours and various activities to experience the host city's culture. Social interaction is a key component of the program, with students networking during mixers and ceremonies. Workshops are also provided throughout the event for students, mentors, and teachers.

### Projects and Judging are categorized into the following 22 scientific disciplines:

+ Animal Sciences
