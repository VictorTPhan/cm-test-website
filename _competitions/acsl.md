## ACSL American Computer Science Thinking Challenge Overview

The American Computer Science League (ACSL) was originally established in Silicon Valley in 1978 as the Rhode Island Computer Science League, later renamed the New England Computer Science League. As more participants from around the world joined, it was renamed the American Computer Science League. With a history spanning over 44 years, ACSL is one of the oldest computer programming competitions for elementary and secondary students in the U.S. The event is officially endorsed by the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) and the Computer Science Teachers Association, and supported by prominent tech and educational companies like Google, Adobe, No Starch Press, O'Reilly Media, Pearson, Pragmatic Bookshelf, and Wolfram. The increasing global emphasis on coding education attracts hundreds of teams and participants from the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa, and Asia annually.

## The Prestige of ACSL

## ACSL Competition Divisions Explained

+ Senior Division: Designed for high school students with extensive programming experience, particularly those studying AP Computer Science. It is recommended that first-time participants in ACSL do not register for this division.

+ Intermediate Division: Suitable for high school students and upper-middle school students with some programming experience, offering a moderate challenge.

+ Junior Division: Intended for middle school students with no programming experience. Students in grade 9 or above are not eligible for this division.

+ Elementary Division: Open to students from grades 3 to 6. The competition consists of non-programming problems covering four categories. Each contest involves a 30-minute test with 5 problems, totaling 5 points.

### Participation Eligibility Adjustments

+ Younger participants with strong programming skills may choose to register for higher-level divisions, e.g., a proficient elementary student may opt for the Intermediate or Junior Division, and a middle schooler for the Senior Division.

+ High school students are not allowed to register for the Elementary and Junior Divisions, and middle school students cannot register for the Elementary Division, ensuring fairness in the competition.
