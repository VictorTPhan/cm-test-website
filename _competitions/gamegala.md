## About Game Gala

GameGala invites K-12 students to showcase their self-developed digital game projects. Students can enter the competition individually or as part of a team. Don’t just play games – become a game creator and developer!

## Competition Rules

+ Each applicant must be a K-12 student enrolled in an educational institution at the time of qualification. Students participate in divisions based on their grade level: K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12. For team projects with students from different grades, the division is determined by the highest grade represented.

+ Each student is limited to one entry per year. Teams can have up to three participants and will compete against individual projects in the same categories. The judging panel will have higher expectations for team projects, proportional to the team size. Projects must be created solely by the participants. If a project submitted as an individual entry is found to have been made by more than one student, it will be disqualified.

+ On Competition Day, participants should prepare a computer to join a live Zoom meeting to demo their game project and program code. Judges will ask questions and evaluate each project.

+ Students not accompanied by their own parents must be under the supervision of an authorized adult escort, teacher, or administrator. GameGala is not responsible for the supervision of any participant.

## Award

+ GameGala awards the top five projects within each age division as First Place, Second Place, Third Place, Fourth Place, and Fifth Place. In addition, innovative project awards, best teamwork awards, and distinguished ideas awards will also be given to each age group.

## Project Submission

+ To participate in GameGala, students or their parents/guardians must complete the online registration form.

+ Each registration must include a project summary. Failure to include a project summary will result in automatic disqualification with no option for appeal. In the case of team submissions, each member must submit an individual application, but only one project summary is needed per team. At least one team member must provide the summary; however, other team members may choose whether or not to include it without any consequences.

+ Project summaries should be clearly written in standard English and effectively convey the project's ideas.

+ Furthermore, all teams are required to provide a link to a two-minute YouTube video showcasing their project demonstration. 

+ Projects must be related to coding and games, such as a playable game, a gaming support tool, or other technical programs that enhance gaming experiences. The essential elements of the projects should focus on "Coding" and "Game." Participants must present a live online demo of their project and explain the technical details to the judges.

+ While existing concepts can inspire projects, they should include new enhancements or developments unique to the student. Submissions that simply replicate existing tutorials, codes, or lessons will not be accepted.

+ Entries not complying with GameGala's regulations may be disqualified.

+ The application fee of $20 is non-refundable.
