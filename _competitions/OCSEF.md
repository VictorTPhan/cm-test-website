## About the Orange County Science and Engineering Fair

The Orange County Science and Engineering Fair (OCSEF) is a nonprofit organization that aims to foster scientific literacy and critical thinking skills among all students in Orange County by providing equal opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. The ultimate event of the year is the annual Orange County Science and Engineering Fair and the STEAM Expo. Students not only have the opportunity to learn and implement scientific methods and engineering design principles but also develop social skills for communication and collaboration, along with the confidence to succeed in the 21st century. To fulfill its mission, OCSEF supports teachers with workshops and mentoring to enhance their science curriculum and to promote local school science and engineering fairs. OCSEF's mission is to enhance students' skills and literacy in science and engineering while encouraging them to consider careers in STEM fields. We are committed to challenging students to explore, design, research, and present scientific and engineering concepts through hands-on experiments.
