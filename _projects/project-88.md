headerTitle: Allergy Detection App Earns Admission to UCSD
bodyText1: "The inspiration for Alice's app came from a personal family need! Living in Beijing, her mother frequently sneezed due to accidental contact with catkins when going outside, and her uncle, who suffers from asthma, once faced a life-threatening situation due to pollen exposure. To prevent such occurrences, Alice designed this app!"
bodyText2: "The Allergy App aims to provide personalized allergy risk assessments. It uses environmental data, such as pollen counts, and personal factors like location, age, and health history, to inform users of their level of allergy risk, helping them understand potential allergic reactions before going outdoors."
