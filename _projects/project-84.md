headerTitle: Bird Recognition Project Secured Cornell Admission
bodyText1: "Charles' AI_Birder aims to provide birdwatchers, especially beginners, with a simple and convenient way to identify the birds they observe. It simplifies the identification process without relying on an internet connection, by uploading a photo of the bird to get information and identification results."
bodyText2: "Charles crafted an intuitive interface using Flutter, supported by the powerful Firebase database for backend operations, and employed TensorFlow's deep learning algorithms to achieve a high accuracy rate of 79% for the AI engine. Without the need for an internet connection or complicated procedures, bird enthusiasts only need a single photo to quickly learn the name of the feathered friend before them."
