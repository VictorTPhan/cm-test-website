headerTitle: “Sabre Technique Video Analysis and Learning Application"
bodyText1: "This application aids beginners in the sport of saber fencing to enhance their skills by analyzing video clips. It utilizes computer vision and pose estimation technologies to process videos, identifying the positions and movements of fencers within the clips, and analyzes scored points and techniques used based on this."
bodyText2: "The application breaks down videos into frames using computer vision and employs a pose estimation algorithm to accurately recognize the posture and movements of fencers. Then, it processes this data to provide insights on scoring and tactics. The system aims to serve as a learning aid, making it easier for novices and fencing enthusiasts to master saber techniques from recorded match videos."
