headerTitle: "AI voice sentiment analysis app for elder"
bodyText1: "Congratulations to Jay on his acceptance into the Biomedical Sciences program at Johns Hopkins University! Back in the early 2020s, when ChatGPT was not yet available, Jay, who was only in the 10th grade at the time, demonstrated a deep insight into social pain points and independently developed a voice sentiment analysis AI model, which is dedicated to improving the emotional companionship of the elderly. By analyzing the emotional fluctuations in voice, the model can accurately identify the psychological state of the elderly and link with the community care system to provide timely care and response for the elderly living alone."
bodyText2: "This project not only puts AI technology into practice in social demand scenarios, but also pioneers the deep integration of scientific and technological innovation with humanistic care, and Jay's explorations confirm Johns Hopkins' pursuit of the concept of “guarding the temperature of human nature with technology” - solving the problems of the real world and letting science and technology solve the problems of the real world with wisdom. To solve the issues in the real world, and to make science and technology truly serve people."
