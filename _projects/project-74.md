headerTitle: Nicky Robotic Arm, life Convenience
bodyText1: "Nicky selected a six-axis servo robotic arm prototype and, under the guidance of Coding Mind, brought it to life by controlling it with Python code through Jupyter Notebook. This created a robotic arm that helps people more easily reach and grab items in their homes."
bodyText2: "Nicky's work extends far beyond constructing a prototype. His project serves as a bridge to freedom and independent living, providing those with mobility issues with a more convenient home environment. This technology could transform the way they interact with the world."
