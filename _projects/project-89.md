headerTitle: Yirina's Ice Skating Technique Analyzer Earns Dual Admission to UCB and CMU
bodyText1: "Yirina noticed that figure skaters often struggle to capture detailed movements on ice without video monitoring. To address this, she designed and developed an ice skating technique analyzer."
bodyText2: "Her project utilizes the QTPY-ESP32 microcontroller, a sensor board, and an SD card reader. These tools allow athletes to record and replay their movements on ice in real time, providing precise analysis of their steps and technical movements."
