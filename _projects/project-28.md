headerTitle: "Baseball technology-assisted student swing speed tracking system"
bodyText1: " Leo loved playing baseball and wanted a way to track his swing speed in real time. To achieve this goal, he built a system that included a processor, a battery, and an antenna, as well as an online service called Firebase. No matter where Leo is, as long as there is a cell tower nearby, the system can run and help him track his swing data."
bodyText2: "This system transmits all swing data to Leo's computer in real time, including each bat speed, bat time stamp, and can even calculate his latest bat speed. All this data is displayed on his computer screen in a clear and easy-to-understand format. This is Leo’s baseball swing speed tracking system, the perfect combination of his love for technology and sports. His project shows how you can use technology to help you improve your athletic skills and stay focused. We look forward to his future performances on the baseball field!"
