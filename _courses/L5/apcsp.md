shortDescription : "The purpose of this course is to help students develop the knowledge and programming skills needed to pass the AP CS P exam"
description: "The AP CSP preparation course does not require a specific programming language, but rather encourages students to program in graphical languages (e.g. Scratch, MIT App Inventor, Snap, etc.). Compared to the original AP CSA, AP CSP emphasizes more on students' understanding and application of practical knowledge. By taking AP CSP, students will master the basic concepts and principles of computer science, while developing problem-solving skills and creative abilities. This course will provide students with the opportunity to open the door to computer science and equip them for a broader future in technology."
