shortDescription : "Learn prealgebra arithmetic, accessible for K-6, and apply mathematics principles in several programming projects along the way."
description: "Mathematics and programming go hand in hand, and nearly all disciplines in STEM apply these two concepts. It's essential for children who aspire for a STEM career to understand how mathematics and computer science interact with each other. In this course, students in K-6 will prepare themselves using prealgebra learning materials and create programs to demonstrate the concepts that they learn."
