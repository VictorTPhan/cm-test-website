shortDescription : "The purpose of this course is to help students develop the knowledge and programming skills needed to pass the AP CS P exam."
description: "The AP CS A exam is one of the premier computer science college-level exams administered by the College Board every year. The exam focuses on conceptual understandings of computer science and programming, such as how computers work and how programming logic extends into real software. Students enrolled in our sprint camp will learn all of the conceptual fundamentals that they need to ace the exam, but also gain assistance in another big portion -- the Create Task, which is a large piece of software that demonstrates a student's mastery of computer science principles."
