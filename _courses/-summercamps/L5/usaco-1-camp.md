shortDescription : "Computer programming algorithm training to prepare for the USA Computing Olympiad"
description: "The USACO, or the United States of America Coding Olympiad is one of the most prestigous coding competitions in the world that challenges high school students to tackle and master difficult programming problems. In this camp, students will begin their trading journey by understanding the fundamental algorithms that are needed in order to ace the USACO contests. The main goal of this course is to transition students from programming to algorithmic thinking. Students to exercise and build a solid foundation for more in-depth informatics competitions."
